## The goal for creating this forum:
To create a community of like-minded people seeking or are in the path of seeking the inner self. Everyone is invited to contribute with their thoughts and experiences.

## The pursuit of the unknown:
All of us are a wanderer. For years and years, we are searching something outside which is located inside us.

## Why do we need to dive inside:
The bliss that we are searching for is located within, but we are searching outside.
The reason for searching outside is because our eyes can see out easily. After all, the light is outside, inside it's all dark, and that's why we are searching outside.
But logically, this is absurd; we will only find the things at the place where it was lost.

## Way to dive inside:
Perhaps, all of our sufferings is because we have forgotten our ancient method of seeking within ourselves.  
For searching within, the total closing of the eyes is needed. Completely closed eyes mean nothing to see.
If you try it, close your eyes and then stop the movements. Let your eyes become just like stones. No movements allowed. One day while practicing this, suddenly, it will happen that you will be able to look within. The eyes which were always looking outside will turn in, and you will have a glimpse inside. A small glimpse is enough to awaken you, and then the rest of the path is revealed on its own.
