title: Seeing a brighter side of life

The fundamental requirement is to make a habit of looking only on the bright side of an event and not the dark side for staying happy. If you want to fly higher, then you should try to become as lightweight as possible, you should drop all your burdens which you are carrying with you. And the biggest burden is sadness. No sadness filled mind can complete a big voyage.

Always ask and check yourself what you are seeing and what you want to see. If you're going to see a glass as half empty or as half full is your choice. 

There is no need for any other reasons for staying happy than knowing that you can still breathe, the sun is still shining, water, air, sky, everything around you is so magical. 

Feel gratitude and stay conscious of your surroundings all the time.  Stay compassionate for all the things around you. Seeing a butterfly, enjoy its beauty, and be aware that it has a very short life. Once you are aware of this, you will automatically be filled with compassion towards it. You see a blossomed flower in the morning, which is smiling for a moment but be aware that it will get withered away with the sunset.  

You are seeing someone who exists now, but no one knows what is hiding in the future. Don't spread sadness around you. Spread compassion on all four sides. The magic behind spreading the joy is that one who tries to spread the joy outside develops the center of happiness inside. 
Fruits do not come from outside; it always develops inside. What we do out, the same Receptivity develops inside us.

A Greek philosopher Socrates was administered poison, but still, he was happy while lying on his death bed. His followers and companion asked him how he can be so delighted when his death was sure and with such great pain. Socrates smilingly said that he knows that now only two things can happen:
Either I will completely die, and then I will not be present to experience this sadness anymore. 
And if I still stay alive, then I will know something that was not me has been destroyed.  
What else can happen? And in both the case there is no reason for staying sad. People can stay happy at the time of death, then why we don't try to stay happy while being alive. 

I will end this article with a well-known story of Buddha. A stranger came near Buddha and spitted on him. Buddha was smiling, but his followers were raged with anger and were about to hit that stranger. Buddha stopped them and said that "he has not done anything wrong, he is just trying to say to me something, but the spoken language is inadequate. That's why he is sharing his emotions without any words."
Many times in our lives, we share emotions like this. We touch and hold each other hands to display our love, hug and embrace others, and cry. It is all because our language is inadequate. Therefore, stay compassionate and grateful towards others and spread happiness.
